To-do list:

Automatic use of threat reducing / player wipe preventing mechanisms on pull aggro (e.g. Soul Shatter / Ice Block)

Automatic healer reassignments
No default ignores for rshamans for now because it won't work as inteded. Need to exclude (in DLL) all trios containing ignored targets for it to work properly.
